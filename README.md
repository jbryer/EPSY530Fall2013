### Course Description

Descriptive statistics including measures of central tendency and variability, correlation and regression. Introduction to statistical inference, including sampling distributions, significance tests, confidence intervals, and power of tests of significance.

### Grading

* Midterm (25%) - In class multiple choice and take home short answers.
* Final exam (25%) - In class multipel choice and take home short answers.
* Homework (20%)
* Project (30%) - The project can be completed individually or in pairs. If you choose to work with a partner you are required to provide a statment that indicates you participated equally and that you understand one grade will be given for the project for both participants. The project will involve analyzing and presenting analysis of a dataset of your choosing. A list of datasets will be provided but other datasets may be used if approved by the instructor.

#### Grade Distribution

A = 93+
A- = 90-92
B+ = 87-89
B = 84-86 
B- = 80-83 
C+ = 75-79

### Software

Although this course will emphasize statistical concepts, we will make occosional use of [R](http://r-project.org), an open source statistics program and language. You are free to [install R](http://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) on your own computers, but you can run R within a [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome) browser at [rstudio.bryer.org](http://rstudio.bryer.org). Your username and password will be provided within the first week of the semester.

**WARNING** KEEP A LOCAL COPY OF ALL YOUR R SCRIPTS AND DATA. I cannot guarantee that the server will always retain a copy of your work. 

### Academic Integrity

Whatever you produce for this course should be your own work and created specifically for this course. You cannot present work produced by others, nor offer any work that you presented or will present to another course. If you borrow text or media from another source or paraphrase substantial ideas from someone else, you must provide a reference to your source.

The University policy on academic dishonesty is clearly outlined in the Student Bulletin, and includes, but is not limited to plagiarism, cheating on examinations, multiple submissions, forgery, unauthorized collaboration, and falsification. These are serious infractions of University regulations and could result in a failing grade for the work in question, a failing grade in the course, or dismissal from the University. http://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html

### Reasonable Accommodation

Reasonable accommodations will be provided for students with documented physical, sensory, sys- temic, cognitive, learning and psychiatric disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring accommodation in this class, please notify the Director of Disabled Student Services (Campus Center 137, 442-5490). That office will provide the course instructor with verification of your dis- ability, and will recommend appropriate accommodations. For more information, visit the website of the UAlbany Office for Disabled Student Services. http://www.albany.edu/studentlife/DSS/ guidelines/accomodation.html
