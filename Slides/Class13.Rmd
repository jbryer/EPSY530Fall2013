## Or but NOT disjoint

Your Wallet
* S = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100}
* A = {odd numbered value} = {1, 5}
* B = {bill with a building} = {5, 10, 20, 50, 100}

Why is P(A or B) ≠ P(A) + P(B)?
* Answer:  A and B are not disjoint.
* The intersection A and B = {$5} is double counted.
* To find P(A or B), subtract P(A and B). 

---  &twocol

## The General Addition Rule

$$P(A\quad or\quad B)  =  P(A) + P(B) – P(A\quad and\quad B)$$

*** left

Add the probabilitiesof the two events and then subtract the probability of their intersection.

P(odd amount or bill with a building) =  
P(A) + P(B) – P(A and B} =   
P({1, 5}) + P({5, 10, 20, 50, 100}) – P({5})

## General Addition Rule Example

Survey
* Are you currently in a relationship?
* Are you involved in sports?

Results
* 33% are in a relationship.
* 25% are involved in sports.
* 11% answered “yes” to both.

Problem
* Find the probability that a randomly selected student is in a relationship or is involved in sports.

33% Relationship, 25% Sport, 11% Both 

Events
* R = {in a relationship}
* S = {involved in sports}
Calculations
* P(R or S) = P(R) + P(S) – P(R and S) = 0.33 + 0.25 – 0.11 = 0.47

Conclusion
* There is a 47% chance that a randomly selected student is in a relationship or is involved sports.

## Using Venn Diagrams

*** left

P(not in relationship and no sports)
* $P(R^C\quad and\quad S^C)$
* This is the part outside of both circles:  0.53.

P(in a relationship but no sports)
* $P(R\quad and\quad S^C)$
* This is the part in the circle R that is outside S:  0.22.

P(in a relationship or involved in sports but not both)
* $P((R\quad and\quad S^C)$ or $(R^C\quad and\quad S))$
* This is the combination of the circles minus the intersection:  0.22 + 0.14  =  0.36

## Contingency Table

A table that displays the results of two categorical questions is called a contingency table.
* P(girl)  = 251/478 = 0.525
* P(girl and popular) = 91/478 = 0.190
* P(sports)  = 90/478 = 0.188

---

## Conditional Probability

What if we knew the chosen personwas a girl? Wouldthat change the probability that the girl’s goal was sports?
* Yes! We write P(sports | girl)
* Only look at Girl row:  P(sports | girl) = 30/251 = 0.120
* Find the probability of selecting a boy given the goal is grades.
* P(boy | grades)  =  117/247 = 0.474

## Conditional Probability Formula

Probability of B given A:

$$P(B|A)=\frac { P(A\quad and\quad B) }{ P(A) } $$

*** left

<center><img src='Figures/Class13-ContTable2.png' width='95%'></center>

*** right 

$P(girl\quad |\quad popular)=\frac { P(girl\quad and\quad popular) }{ P(popular) }$  

$P(girl\quad |\quad popular)=\frac { 91/478 }{ 141/478 } $  

$P(girl\quad |\quad popular)=\frac { 91 }{ P(141) } = 0.65$

---

## The General Multiplication Rule

* For A and B independent, we had:  
	P(A and B)  =  P(A) × P(B)

* Rearranging the conditional probability equation, we get the General Multiplication Rule:  
	P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B | A)

* Equivalently,  
	P(A and B) = P(B) × P(A | B)

---

## Independence

Events A and B are independent if knowing A happened does not change the probability of B. Symbolically:  
* A and B are independent ↔ P(B | A) = P(B)

Equivalent formulas for independence:
* P(A | B)  =  P(A)
* P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)

--- &twocol

## Grades and Girl Independent?

*** left

Determine if the goal of good grades and sex are independent.
* P(grades | girl)  =  130/251 ≈ 0.52
* P(grades)  =  247/478 ≈ 0.52
* To two decimal places, they are independent.

Are the goal of sports and sex independent?
* P(sports | boy) = 60/227 ≈ 0.26
* P(sports) = 90/478 ≈ 0.19
* No, the goal of sports and sex are dependent.

## Relationships, Sports, and Independence

33% in a relationship, 25% involved in sports, 11% both

Are being in a relationship and being involved in sports independent?
* P(relationship) = 0.33
* P(sports)  =  0.25
* P(relationship and sports) = 0.11
* 0.33 × 0.25  =  0.0825 ≠ 0.11
* No, they are dependent.

Are they disjoint?
* P(relationship and sports) = 0.11 ≠ 0
* No, they are not disjoint.

---

## Independent ≠ Disjoint

Disjoint events cannot be independent.

Consider the events:
* Course grade A
* Course grade B
* Disjoint:  You can’t get both.
* Not  independent:  P(A | B) = 0 ≠ P(A)
* A and B are disjoint (also called mutually exclusive) but not independent.

## Marginal and Joint Probabilities

*** left

* 73% use e-mail, 62% text, 49% both
* Draw a partial table

* 0.73 and 0.62 are called marginal probabilities.
* 0.49 is a joint probability.

How can we complete the table?

* Draw a partial table

* 0.73 and 0.62 are called marginal probabilities.
* 0.49 is a joint probability.

How can we complete the table?

* The sum must add up
* 0.49 + ? = 0.73
* 0.62 + ? = 1.00

## 73% Use E-mail, 62% Text, 49% Both

*** left

1. E-mail and text mutually exclusive?
2. E-mail and text independent?

Plan:
* A = {uses e-mail}
* B = {texts}
* P(A) = 0.73
* P(B) = 0.62
* P(A and B) = 0.49

* B = {texts}
* P(A) = 0.73
* P(B) = 0.62
* P(A and B) = 0.49

*** right

1. E-mail and text mutually exclusive?

* P(A and B) = 0.49 ≠ 0
* Conclusion:  E-mail and text are not mutually exclusive.

2. E-mail and text independent?

2. E-mail and text independent?

* Make a table

<center><img src='Figures/Class13-MarginTable2.png' width='60%'></center>

* P(B | A) = 0.49/0.73 ≈ 0.67
* P(B) = 0.62 ≠ 0.67
* Not independent
* Conclusion:  Since the respondents who use e-mail are more likely to text, they are not independent.

## Tree Diagrams

* Venn diagrams and tables are not great for conditional probabilities.
